                <h3>Best Practices</h3>
                <p>Good cybersecurity starts with smart habits. Use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Keep your software and operating systems up to date to patch known vulnerabilities. Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments. These simple steps can dramatically reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks.</p>
