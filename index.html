            <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. As our lives become increasingly connected through technology, the need to secure personal and organizational information has never been more critical. From securing your email to defending entire corporate infrastructures, cybersecurity spans a wide range of tools and techniques designed to keep digital environments safe.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices</h3>
                <p>Good cybersecurity starts with smart habits. Use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Keep your software and operating systems up to date to patch known vulnerabilities. Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments. These simple steps can dramatically reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks.</p>

                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Cybersecurity professionals rely on a variety of tools to monitor, detect, and prevent threats. Tools like Wireshark help analyze network traffic, while Nmap scans for open ports and vulnerabilities. Password managers like Bit warden or 1Password help users maintain strong credentials securely. Learning how these tools work — and when to use them — is essential for anyone pursuing a career in cybersecurity.</p>
